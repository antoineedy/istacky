## About The Project

__IStacky__ is a __lightweight image processing library__ based on the [Ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) library and designed to be used in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). The main idea is to provide a __simple__ and __intuitive interface__ to __stack images__ and apply number of modifications to them, such as __cropping__, __resizing__ or __background removal__.

This project has been made to be used in the context of __machine learning__ and __computer vision projects__, where the user needs to __quickly__ and __easily__ create output images that combines several images: plots, photos, logos etc.

## The future

I wonder if I (we?) should extend this project to create a Photoshop-like interface using the ipywidgets library. I really don't know any use to this project. Let me know if you have any ideas! See the [open issues](https://github.com/antoineedy/istacky/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
